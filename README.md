# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to perform exploratory analysis of Pyber ride sharing data in order to gain an understanding of ridership and fare metrics by the type of cities in which Pyber operates. And then creating visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing servies and determine afoordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

## Results
Through analysis and aggregation of PyBer ride sharing data, I have created a statistical overview and summary.

By reviewing the summary, we can see that there are several key findings including;
  - Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least
  - Urban cities have 4x+ more drivers than suburban cities
  - Suburban cities have 6x+ drivers than rural with almost 4.5x the revenue
  - Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver
  - The summary data shows a relationship in which fare revuenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides

## Summary
Based on the analysis, my recommendations for PyBer is to increase the amount of drivers in rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet the ride demand. Data for rual cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than suburban and urban cities. This can indicate that the rual area based riders are taking trips over a longer distance. This can result in a majority of drivers being occupied with the current trips and loss in potential revenue when there are peaks in business. 

In addition, I suggest to charge more per mile in urban cities because trips most likely are shorter and drivers don't earn as much per trip. And lastly. make small charge increases or decreases bases off of how many riders there are in the city during certain months.
